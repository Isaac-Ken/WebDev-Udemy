                <h3>Hunting adaptations</h3>
                <p>
                    All owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live on diets of insects, small rodents and lagomorphs.
                    Some owls are also specifically adapted to hunt fish. They are very adept in hunting in their
                    respective environments. Since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world and across a multitude of ecosystems, their
                    hunting skills and characteristics vary slightly from species to species, though most characteristics are shared among all species

                <h3>Camouflage</h3>
                <p>The coloration of the owl's plumage plays a key role in its ability to sit still and blend into the environment, making it nearly
                    invisible to prey. Owls tend to mimic the coloration and sometimes the texture patterns of their surroundings, the barn owl being
                    an exception. The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) appears nearly bleach-white in color with a few flecks of black, mimicking their
                    snowy surroundings perfectly, while the speckled brown plumage of the tawny owl (Strix aluco) allows it to lie in wait among the
                    deciduous woodland it prefers for its habitat. Likewise, the mottled wood-owl (Strix ocellata) displays shades of brown, tan and
                    black, making the owl nearly invisible in the surrounding trees, especially from behind. Usually, the only tell-tale sign of a
                    perched owl is its vocalizations or its vividly colored eyes

            <p>Most owls are nocturnal, actively hunting their prey in darkness. Several types of owls are crepuscularâ€”active during the twilight
                hours of dawn and dusk; one example is the pygmy owl (Glaucidium). A few owls are active during the day, also; examples are the
                burrowing owl (Speotyto cunicularia) and the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus)</p>
